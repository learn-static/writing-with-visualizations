Thank you for choosing to lead your class through this project. 
You need not be a web developer or particularly technically inclined to run this class! 
Instructions for setting up the project and working on it with your class are here to help you and your students walk through the process of creating a digital exhibit of oral histories or interview transcripts.

This section provides information for instructors regarding how to incorporate the Writing with Visualizations tool into the classroom or workshop setting, including an example assignment and learning objectives.

**Goals for Students:**

- Copy a GitHub repository and turn on GitHub Pages
- Navigate directories and subdirectories on GitHub
- Write and format content for the web using Markdown
- Create, copy, and paste [Liquid](http://shopify.github.io/liquid/) "include" code to incorporate images, documents, and visualizations into a multimedia essay webpage
- Analyze historical texts using distant reading methods

**Estimated Time to Complete this Section:** ~1 Hour+ (depending on whether you generate topics for your text beforehand or later with your students)

## Section Overview

The Writing with Visualizations learning sequence is intended for an audience of undergraduate and graduate students or faculty, and may be taught in an extended workshop or classroom setting.

Following these instructions, students will learn to navigate GitHub, gain an introduction to Digital Humanities (DH), text analysis, and topic modeling, and produce a multi-media essay via a GitHub Pages website that incorporates text interwoven with images, pdfs, videos, and DH visualizations.

This project template can be applied to multiple disciplines, and implemented with or without the DH emphasis.
To this end, while the project template's topic modeling feature contains data intended for history students by default, this data can be supplemented or exchanged with whatever the instructor prefers.

**About the data used for this project:**

The State of the Union Addresses and Party Platforms used for the text analysis and topic modeling in this project template were obtained from the University of California Santa Barbara's [American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. 
This data can be found in multiple formats in the project template's GitHub repository in the [/assets/data/folder](https://github.com/learn-static/text-analysis/tree/main/assets/data){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

Only Democratic and Republican parties were included in our 20th-century Party Platforms data.

Topic modeling was performed on these texts using the [jsLDA](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/jsLDA/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} tool by David Mimno. Information on the number of iterations performed on each corpus can be found in the project template's GitHub repository at [_data/topic-data.csv](https://github.com/learn-static/text-analysis/blob/main/_data/topic-data.csv){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} spreadsheet.

The stopword list used for the State of the Union Address topic modeling and analysis is the Buckley-Salton stopword list, retrieved from Alan Liu workshop at [http://dhworkshop.pbworks.com/w/file/105416844/Buckley-Salton-stopword-list.txt](http://dhworkshop.pbworks.com/w/file/105416844/Buckley-Salton-stopword-list.txt){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. The Buckley-Salton stopword list was also used for the Party Platforms, with the addition of three words: america, american, and americans.

To use this project in the classroom, you will 

To set this project up, you will be asked to set up a github repository, edit a text file, invite your students to contribute to the repository, create a controlled vocabulary, and publish your site on GitHub Pages.

If you need a gentle introduction to GitHub, we created the [Learn Static GitHub Foundations Module](https://github.com/learn-static/foundations-0-github/blob/main/intro-github.md) to help you and your students better understand the basics of Git and GitHub. 
Since you will only be using GitHub via a web interface, however, you may not need much help, as the interactions will be very similar to those you might do with files on your computer.

If you do run into trouble, please feel free to reach out to the Learn-Static team by submitting an issue on the [Learn Static - Writing with Visualizations](https://github.com/learn-static/writing-with-visualizations/issues) projectâ€™s Issue Board.

**Aligned Learning Standards**:

INSTRUCTIONS: It is optional and suggested to identify standards/frameworks/competencies that align with your learning sequence and define what learners should know and be able to do within a content area at specific stages in their education (for example, the [ACRL Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education](https://www.ala.org/acrl/standards/ilframework) or [ISTE Standards](https://www.iste.org/standards/iste-standards-for-students)).
