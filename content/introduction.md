Oral History as Data (OHD) is a static web framework that will let you publish a collection of oral history/qualitative interviews online. This project asks you to copy a working repository of interviews and replace them with your own.

To do that, Instructors will follow these steps:

    Make a copy of the OHD GitHub Repository
    Edit a Config file to describe your project.
    Create a controlled vocabularly with your students
    Customize and Publish your site using GitHub Pages

To get started as an instructor, go to the For Instructors Section Overview Page.

And students will follow these steps:

    Transform your interview text into a spreadsheet
    Code sections of your transcripts by subject, using the controlled vocabularly created by the class
    Publish your transcript by your transcriptâ€™s CSV and a Markdown file describing your interview
    Engage with the class collection via presentation or critical essay

To get started as a student, go to the Prepare Your Transcript Section Overview Page.

At the end of the process you will have a fully baked website that publishes each of your transcripts and allows for users to search interviews by keyword or browse by the topics you define in your controlled vocabulary. The site will feature some spiffy visualizations to entice engagement.

The Writing with Visualizations learning sequence is intended for an audience of undergraduate and graduate students or faculty, and may be taught in an extended workshop or classroom setting.

Following these instructions, students will learn to navigate GitHub, gain an introduction to Digital Humanities (DH), text analysis, and topic modeling, and produce a multi-media essay via a GitHub Pages website that incorporates text interwoven with images, pdfs, videos, and DH visualizations.

This project template can be applied to multiple disciplines, and implemented with or without the DH emphasis.
To this end, while the project template's topic modeling feature contains data intended for history students by default, this data can be supplemented or exchanged with whatever the instructor prefers.

**About the data used for this project:**

The State of the Union Addresses and Party Platforms used for the text analysis and topic modeling in this project template were obtained from the University of California Santa Barbara's [American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. 
This data can be found in multiple formats in the project template's GitHub repository in the [/assets/data/folder](https://github.com/learn-static/text-analysis/tree/main/assets/data){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

Only Democratic and Republican parties were included in our 20th-century Party Platforms data.

Topic modeling was performed on these texts using the [jsLDA](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/jsLDA/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} tool by David Mimno. Information on the number of iterations performed on each corpus can be found in the project template's GitHub repository at [_data/topic-data.csv](https://github.com/learn-static/text-analysis/blob/main/_data/topic-data.csv){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} spreadsheet.

The stopword list used for the State of the Union Address topic modeling and analysis is the Buckley-Salton stopword list, retrieved from Alan Liu workshop at [http://dhworkshop.pbworks.com/w/file/105416844/Buckley-Salton-stopword-list.txt](http://dhworkshop.pbworks.com/w/file/105416844/Buckley-Salton-stopword-list.txt){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. The Buckley-Salton stopword list was also used for the Party Platforms, with the addition of three words: america, american, and americans.
